# Introduction

Before getting started with **{{ product.name }}**, we must first explore and prepare the different tools we'll need in order to go beyond the basics on this Business Automation journey.

We'll be using different tools as we move through the guided exercises: 
- During development, we'll use IBM Business Automation Open Editions **{{ product.canvas }}**, which is known in the open-source as {{ product.sandbox }}.
- To set up the local workstation, we'll use VSCode Plugins, Maven, GraalVM and more. 
- Since our goal with this enablement is to move towards Kogito adoption and its cloud-native approach, we'll mostly use 
{{ product.canvas }} and VSCode. Although, you can also find extra exercises covering the usage of Business Central, supported on the 8.x version.
