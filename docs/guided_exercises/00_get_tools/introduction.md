# Introduction

In this section, we will look at the different toolings that are available with {{ product.name }}. These will be both from what is in the community (and soon to be enterprise supported) in the KIE Sandbox to setting up your local workstation with the VSCode Plugins, Maven, GraalVM and more. This section will cover Business Central as it is what is enterprise supported (and what most customers will already be using), but our goal with this enablement will be to move the product towards Kogito and its Cloud Native strategies over the legacy runtimes found within KIE Server and Business Central.
