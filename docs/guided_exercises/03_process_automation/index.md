# Getting Started with Process Automation

In this section, you will become familiar with the foundational concepts of IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions (BAMOE) and use the main features of {{ product.canvas }} for process automation using BPMN.

## Goals:

- Clone the starter project created with the accelerator using git
- Download to the computer to work on VSCode using the Dev Tools extensions
- Use Quarkus dev mode and use the management console and task inbox
- Expand the process design: Script Task, Human Task, Timer Event, Service Task
