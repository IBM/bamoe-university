# KIE App Configuration

The definition of the expected state of KIE-App environment is defined in the YAML definition the KIE-App. In this section we will slightly change this configuration to see how the Operator applies changes in the configuration of your Red Hat Process Automation Manager environment.

## Changing Credentials

1.  Go back to the YAML definition of your `rhpam-trial` KieApp.

2.  Add a `commonConfig` section, with the `adminUser` to the value `pamAdmin`, and the `adminPassword` to `redhatpam1!`. Click on the **Save** button.

##  Adding a KIE-Server

Apart from changing some configuration parameters, we can also change the topology our deployment in the KieApp YAML file.

1.  Go back to the YAML definition of your `rhpam-trial` KieApp.

2.  Add a `servers` section and set the `replicas` parameter of the `rhpam-trial-kieserver` to **2**. ![](../images/business_automation/operator/ks-replica-config.png){:width="650px"}

	```
	objects:

	      replicas: 2
	```

3.  Click the **Save** button.
