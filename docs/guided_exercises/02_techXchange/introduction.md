# {{ product.name }} labs at IBM TechXchange 2023

Welcome to Session 1717 at IBM TechXchange where we will cover using {{ product.name }} and target our deployment for OpenShift Container Platform. In this session you will learn several aspects of the {{ product.short }} architecture and how some of the components work together to help provide a Cloud Native Business Decision Model using {{ product.canvas }}, Quarkus, and more to see how you can quickly deploy solutions to your cloud environment. This session will focus predominantly on the {{ product.short }} 9.0 release, where we will focus on building a DMN model and build a Kogito Decision Service, there are two labs focused on this, coupled with some extra content that if you have time to review on DMN. Also available to you are the labs that are focused on Process Automation Manager Open Edition. These are built on the 8.0.3 stream for the purposes of this lab as we are currently in the process of moving the process framework to the Kogito architecture which when TechXchange 2024 comes around we hope to show you more!
